\begin{theorem}\label{thm:muformtoparform}\cite[Theorem 6.35]{venema2024modalmucalculus}
 There is an algorithm that constructs, for a clean formula $\xi\in \mu$-ML$(\Psf)$, an equivalent parity formula $\mathbb{H}_\xi = (V_\xi, E_\xi, L_\xi, \Omega_\xi, \xi)$, based on the subformula graph of $\xi$
\end{theorem}
\textbf{Discussion}: Theorem 6.35 from \cite{venema2024modalmucalculus} works with $\mu$-ML formulas. Now we can adjust this definition to work with $\mu$-TL formulas that are $U/R$ free and transform this to linear parity formulas. The proof will follow the proof of Venema but has to be worked out in a later stadium (also discussing how much I can refer to Venema and how much I have to show myself in the thesis).
