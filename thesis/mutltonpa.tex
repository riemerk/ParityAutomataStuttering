In the final section of this chapter we will connect all theorems to prove the main theorem of this chapter.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:mutltonpa}
 Let $\phi$ be a tidy $\mutl$ formula. Without loss of generality assume $\phi$ is guarded. Then there exists an equivalent \npa\, $\A_\phi$ where
 \[
  \Mod_\Psf(\phi) = \LL(\A_\phi)
 \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
 This proof follows all the translations and equivalences presented in Chapter 3. We first translate $\phi$ to a parity formula $\G_\phi$ as described in Definition \ref{def:parformofmutl}. Following Theorem \ref{thm:parformequivmutl} we know that $\G_\phi$ is equivalent to $\phi$. Now we will translate the parity formula $\G_\phi$ to the parity formula $\G^s_\phi$ according to Definition \ref{def:simpleparform} which is simple guarded and equivalent to $\G_\phi$ by Theorem \ref{thm:parformsimple} and the fact that $\phi$ is guarded. Following   Theorem \ref{thm:parformsimpleofmutlsimple} and the fact that $\phi$ is guarded and modal simple gives us a strongly guarded and modal simple parity formula $\G^s_\phi$. With Theorem \ref{thm:parformtoapa} we can translate this parity formula to an \apa\, $\A^a_\phi$. Finally with Corollary \ref{cor:apatonpa} we see that there exists an equivalent \npa\, $\A^n_\phi$ which concludes our theorem.
\end{proof}
The following proposition will be helpful in the next chapter.
\begin{lemma}\label{prop:mutltonpatranslationboolean}
Let $\phi$ be a $\mutl$ formula and $\A_\phi$ as in Theorem \ref{thm:mutltonpa}. Then we have
\[
 \LL(\A_\phi)\cup\LL(\A_\psi)=\Mod_\Psf(\phi\lor\psi) \text{ and }\LL(\A_\phi)\cap\LL(\A_\psi)=\Mod_\Psf(\phi\land\psi)
\]

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 \textcolor{red}{TODO}
\end{proof}
% \begin{proof}
% This proof will follow a chain of theorems in this booklet. First of all transform $\phi$ to a $U/R$ free formula using theorem \ref{thm:mutlformURfree}. Then use theorem  to transform this to a strongly guarded and simple parity formula. Use theorem \ref{thm:parformtoapa} to transform this to an APA. Finally use definition to transform this to a NPA. This transformation is correct using theorem \ref{thm:APAtoNPA}. Now we have
% \[
%   \Mod_\Psf(\phi) = \LL(\A)
% \]
% \end{proof}
